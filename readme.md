An interactive web experience for the band TELOS and our 2023 album "DELUDE".

## About

I play guitar in TELOS, a blackened hardcore/mathcore band from the DIY hardcore scene in Copenhagen, Denmark. As part of my bachelor's degree in Digital Concept Development, I created this project to explore a new way of presenting music digitally.

The concept is rooted in the theory of "System 1 & 2" by Daniel Kahneman. Instead of simply pressing play, users must complete an action to unlock each song - reflecting how hardcore music itself requires patience and effort to appreciate.

## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- p5.js (audio/visuals)

## How It Works

1. Choose one of the 4 songs
2. Each song has a hidden interaction required to play it
3. White noise plays until you figure out the correct action
4. Complete the action to unlock the music

### The Songs

- **BASTION** - Move your cursor
- **NEVER ME** - Use your microphone
- **I'VE BEEN GONE FOR SO LONG** - Type the word
- **THRONE** - Find the right button
